## Space Travel Game

This document describes a small game of space travel that I constructed. In this game, the player is given a certain amount of resources and must use those resources to travel to another planet. Once the player reaches the other planet, they can restock their inventories before continuing their journey.

**Gameplay**

The game is played on a turn-based basis. On each turn, the player can choose to perform one of the following actions:

* Travel to another planet: This will use up some of the player's resources.
* Restock their inventories: This will allow the player to purchase more resources.
* Scan the current planet: This will provide the player with information about the planet's resources and any dangers that may be present.

The game ends when the player either reaches their destination planet or runs out of resources.

**Resources**

The player's resources are represented by three different types of fuel:

* Hydrogen: Used for travel.
* Oxygen: Used for life support.
* Water: Used for drinking and other essential tasks.

The player can purchase more resources at any planet that they visit.

**Dangers**

Some planets may contain dangers, such as asteroids or black holes. If the player encounters a danger, they may lose some of their resources or even their ship.

**Victory**

The player wins the game by reaching their destination planet with at least one unit of each resource.

**Conclusion**

This space travel game is a simple but challenging game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It is a great way to learn about the basics of space travel and resource management.
